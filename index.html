<h3>A workflow helper for Solidworks</h3>

<p>This tool automates the process of creating new parts and assemblies in
<a href="http://www.solidworks.com/">SolidWorks</a>,
entering them into project's database, and assigning them custom property
(such as part name) that is also visible in the database records. It can also perform
few batch operations on files in the database.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<a class="big" href="https://github.com/spitfire05/SwProjectInterface/releases/latest">Latest release</a>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>SwProjectInterface requires
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21">.NET 3.5 Framework</a>
to run, and, obviously, SolidWorks.</p>

<p>The tool was developed & tested with SolidWorks 2013, but should work flawlessly
also with SolidWorks 2014</p>
